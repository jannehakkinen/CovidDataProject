# CovidDataProject

In this project I used free covid data and I made a dashboard with Europe's current Covid vaccination situation. The dashboard was made with Tableau and can be found here: *link*
The original dataset was downloaded from here https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths on 20.1.2022. Then I parsed it with Excel and then imported the data to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. There I did queries to get certain tables and imported those to excel sheets. I imported those excel sheets to Tableau and made the dashboard. With free Tableau I couldn't connect it to SQL and therefore I had to use excel inbetween. SQL queries can be found: *mist√§*?
